# physicsEngineExperiments
A small physics engine project I'm buliding to learn more about C++,and well physics engine design.

For now it just simulates objects (blobs) and their motion and interactions.

Key Inputs:
WSAD - move camera 
Left Click - spawn new blob
Left Click + A - spawn a new anchor blob (not affected by gravity / collisions)
Right Click - inspect blob
Right Click + M - move particle to a new location 
Right Click + R - set new radius 
T - freeze / unfreeze time 
G - magnetize particles (all particles will attract each other)
